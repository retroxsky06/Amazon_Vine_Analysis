# Amazon Vine Analysis
Module 16 Challenge

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze Amazon customer reviews of the paid Amazon Vine program, which is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Utilizing PySpark, the ETL process will extract the dataset, transform the data and connect to an AWS RDS instance.  The transformed data will then be loaded into pgAdmin.  Lastly, Pandas is used to determine if there is any bias towards favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset.  

### Technical Analysis Deliverables
- Deliverable 1: Perform ETL on Amazon Product Reviews
- Deliverable 2: Determine Bias of Vine Reviews

### Software & Resources
-	PySpark
-	PostgreSQL
-	AWS RDS
-	Pandas
-	Dataset: The dataset derived from 
[Amazon Review Dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/index.txt) list. The chosen dataset for this analysis is the [Book dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Books_v1_02.tsv.gz!) (1 of 3).

## Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)
Using PySpark, the book dataset is extracted into four dataframes: customers_df, 


## Results

- no vine paid
-  all that weere filtered were not paid
- This was a dataset that had 2 others.. need to examine the other 2 datasets to review if there were any other..
- a dataset of 3 million and became fitlered to 40oK that are helpful reviews
